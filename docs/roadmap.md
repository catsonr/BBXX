there are a number of features planned for **BBXX**. they are listed below in rough chronological order

- [ ] opengl & opengl ES support
- [ ] game code hot reloading
- [ ] frame timing system
- [ ] input handling
- [ ] audio playback
- [ ] accurate text rendering
- [ ] some screen state system

these are essentially requirements, and should take priority over other features
